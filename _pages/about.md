I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp). I have mainly focused on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the [Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp), where I contributed to the [AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml/), a well-established framework to easily add and train new parameters within transformer-based language models and research projects related to adapters.
