We introduce M2QA, a multi-domain multilingual question answering benchmark. M2QA includes 13,500 SQuAD 2.0-style question-answer instances in German, Turkish, and Chinese for the domains of product reviews, news, and creative writing. We use M2QA to explore cross-lingual cross-domain performance of fine-tuned models and state-of-the-art LLMs and investigate modular approaches to domain and language adaptation.
